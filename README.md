ESP32 WebSocket Server

Overview

This is a Node.js WebSocket server designed to facilitate real-time communication between an ESP32 microcontroller and a client. The ESP32 establishes a WebSocket connection with the server, and messages sent by the client are relayed to the ESP32.

Project structure: 
```
ESP32_WebSocket_Server/
â”‚â”€â”€ server.js             # Main WebSocket server
â”‚â”€â”€ package.json          # Node.js dependencies
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md             # Documentation
```
ðŸ“¦ Dependencies:

â€¢	Node.js (>=16.x) \n
â€¢	ws (WebSocket library for Node.js)
	
1: Clone the repository:
```
  git clone https://github.com/maxkoste/ESP32_server_project.git
  cd ESP32_server_project
```
2: Install dependencies:
```	
 npm install ws
``` 
3: Run the websocket server

 	node server.js


 ESP32 Connection:
  	â€¢	The ESP32 should connect to the server at ws://<server-ip>:8080.
	â€¢	Any message sent from a client will be forwarded to the ESP32.

 Usage
	â€¢	The ESP32 connects as the first client and is recognized as the main WebSocket device.
	â€¢	Other clients can connect and send messages to the ESP32 through the server.
	â€¢	Logs will display incoming and forwarded messages.

Example Output:
```
Client connected!
ESP32 connected!
Received message from client: Hello ESP32!
Sending message to ESP32: Hello ESP32!
Client disconnected!
ESP32 disconnected!
```
